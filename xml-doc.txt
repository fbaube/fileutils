If the document has a DOCTYPE with a public identifier containing "XHTML,"
such as -//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN, then it is definitely XML.

On the other hand, a DOCTYPE with a public identifier containing "HTML,"
such as -//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN, means it is HTML, not XML.

If the DOCTYPE has a system identifier but no public identifier, then it
must be XML, cos XML removed the need for a public identifier in DOCTYPEs.

If the document has an empty DOCTYPE of <!DOCTYPE html>, then it is HTML5.

If we reach the first start tag in the document and none of the heuristic
rules have matched yet, then examine the attributes on the root element.
Any xmlns, xmlns:*, or xml:* attributes, such as xml:lang or xml:base,
mean that the document is XML.
